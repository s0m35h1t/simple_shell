This project is intended to create a simplified version of the linux shell.  
this simplified version must contain the same functions as the original version.  
It includes everything we learned in previous projects, see C language and linux.

## <a id="Usage_9"></a>Usage

the use of our simple shell is as simple as the original version that was created under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Operating system using the C language. just type commands and functions in the terminal and you will have the same result as the simple shell.
